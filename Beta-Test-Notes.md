## Kevin:
- Cube is too slow
- Would be more helpful for platform control to be operated by another hand
- Lovely music. Feels elevator-esque
- Physical correlation of puzzles add an extra layer of tangibility.
- Overall very pleasant experience. Especially appreciated the intricately programmed puzzles.

# ***William HARRIS***:

- I think it's cool.
- Needs more puzzles
- More sound effects?
- Use a meow-synth sfx to delete platforms
